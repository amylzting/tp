## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stock/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/stock/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stock/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/stock/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stock/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `StockBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a stock).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stock/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the stock book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stock/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the stock book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.stock.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### General Features
General features that are used in many of the implemented features are defined here.

#### StockBookParser
The `StockBookParser` is used to parse a full user input to determine if the user input corresponds to any of the
`COMMAND_WORD` in the various command classes. If the the user input does not conform the any of the expected format
required, Warenager will produce an error message.

### Suggestion Feature

The mechanism for suggestion feature is facilitated by `SuggestionCommandParser, SuggestionCommand, SuggestionUtil`.

#### SuggestionCommand

`SuggestionCommand` class extends `Command` interface. `SuggestionCommand` class is tasked with creating a new `CommandResult`
with the suggestion message to be displayed to the user as its argument. The suggestion message to be displayed
is gathered from the result of the parsing stage for suggestion.

Some of the important operations implemented here are:

* `SuggestionCommand#execute()`
  Generates a new `CommandResult` with the suggestion message as its argument.

#### SuggestionCommandParser
`SugestionCommandParser` class extends `Parser` interface. `SuggestionCommandParser` class is tasked with parsing the
user inputs and generate a new `SuggestionCommand`. The main logic of the suggestion feature is encapsulated here.

`SuggestionCommandParser` receives the user input, along with either the faulty command word or parsing error messages
from another `Parser` object. The `parse` method inside the `SuggestionCommandParser` will then try to infer the best
possible correct command format using the minimum edit distance heuristic provided inside `SuggestionUtil`.

Some of the important operations implemented here are:

* `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` <br>
  Parses the user input and parsing error messages thrown from another `Parser` and returns a new `SuggestionCommand`
  with the suggestion to be shown as its argument. The inference for the command word to be suggested is made in here.
  After the correct command word is inferred, then it will call helper functions to generate the suggestion messages.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateAddSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for an add command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateListSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a list command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateHelpSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a help command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateExitSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a exit command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for an update command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateDeleteSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a delete command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateFindSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a find command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateFindExactSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a find exact command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateStatisticsSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a stats command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateNoteSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a note command.
* `SuggestionCommandParser#generateNoteDeleteSuggestion()` <br>
  Generates the suggestion message for a note delete command.

#### SuggestionUtil

`SuggestionUtil` class contains the utilities needed to infer the suggestion to be displayed to the user.

The utilities provided inside are:

* `SuggestionUtil#min()` <br>
  Computes the minimum of three integers.
* `SuggestionUtil#minimumEditDistance()` <br>
  Computes the minimum edit distance between 2 strings.

#### Example Usage Scenario

Given below are some example usage scenarios and how the suggestion mechanism behaves at each step.

**Example 1: Unknown command word**

Step 1. The user enters `updt n/Milk s/Fairprice` which contains an unknown command word `updt`.

Step 2. The command word `updt` is extracted out in `StockBookParser` and checked if it matches any valid command word.

Step 3. The command word `updt` does not match any valid command word. It is then passed down to `SuggestionCommandParser`
along with `n/Milk s/Fairprice` and `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` is invoked.

Step 4. Inside `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` method, the closest command word to `updt` will be inferred.
The inference uses the minimum edit distance heuristic. `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` will
count the minimum edit distance from `updt` to every other valid command word.

Step 5. The new valid command word generated is the one with the smallest edit distance to `updt`. The command word
to be suggested in this case is `update`.

Step 6. `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` method will call `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()`
to generate the suggestion message to be displayed to the user.

Step 7. During the generation of suggestion message, `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()` will check
first if the compulsory prefix exist. In this case the compulsory prefix which is `sn/` does not exist.
`sn/<serial number>` is then added to the suggestion message.

Step 8. All prefixes the user entered that is valid for `update` command and its arguments are nonempty will then
be appended to the suggestion message. If there exist prefix whose argument is empty, then `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()`
will fill the argument with a default value. In this case, prefixes `n/ s/` are present and their arguments are nonempty.
`n/Milk s/Fairprice` is then added to the suggestion message.

Step 9. Lastly `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()` will append the usage message for `update` command.

Step 10. `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` method returns a new `SuggestionCommand` with the suggestion message
to be displayed as its argument.

Step 11. `SuggestionCommand` is executed and produces a new `CommandResult` to display the message to the user.

Step 12. The suggestion `update sn/<serial number> n/Milk s/Fairprice` is displayed to the user along with what kind of
error and the message usage information. In this case the error is `unknown command` and the message usage is from
`UpdateCommand`.

**Example 2: Invalid command format**

Step 1. The user enters `update n/Milk s/` which contains a valid command word `update`.

Step 2. The command word `update` is extracted out in `StockBookParser` and checked if it matches any valid command word.

Step 3. The command word `update` is a valid command word. Input is then passed to `UpdateCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 4. Inside `UpdateCommandParser#parse()`, the user input is then parsed to create a new `UpdateCommand`. However,
since the compulsory prefix `sn/` is not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

Step 5. `ParseException` thrown will be caught in `StockBookParser`. The user input along with parsing error messages
will then be passed into `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 6. Constructor of `SuggestionCommandParser` will separate the parsing error messages header and body and then
`SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` is invoked.

Step 7. Inside `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` method, the closest command word to `update` will be inferred.
The inference uses the minimum edit distance heuristic. `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` will
count the minimum edit distance from `update` to every other valid command word.

Step 8. Since `update` is already a valid command, the inference will generate `update` again.

Step 9. `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` method will call `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()`
to generate the suggestion message to be displayed to the user.

Step 10. During the generation of suggestion message, `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()` will check
first if the compulsory prefix exist. In this case the compulsory prefix which is `sn/` does not exist.
`sn/<serial number>` is then added to the suggestion message.

Step 11. All prefixes the user entered that is valid for `update` command and its arguments are nonempty will then
be appended to the suggestion message. If there exist prefix whose argument is empty, then `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()`
will fill the argument with a default value. In this case, the prefix `n/` is present and its argument is nonempty.
`n/Milk` is then added to the suggestion message. The prefix `s/` is present, but its argument is empty.
`s/<source>` is then added to the suggestion message.

Step 9. Lastly `SuggestionCommandParser#generateUpdateSuggestion()` will append the usage message for `update` command.

Step 10. `SuggestionCommandParser#parse()` method returns a new `SuggestionCommand` with the suggestion message
to be displayed as its argument.

Step 11. `SuggestionCommand` is executed and produces a new `CommandResult` to display the message to the user.

Step 12. The suggestion `update sn/<serial number> n/Milk s/<source>` is displayed to the user along with what kind of
error and the message usage information. In this case the error is `Invalid command format` and the message usage is from
`UpdateCommand`.

![Suggestion Example 2](images/SuggestionSequenceDiagramExample2.png)

#### Minimum Edit Distance Heuristic

The minimum edit distance between two strings is defined as the minimum cost needed to transform one into the other.

The transformation cost comes from the types of editing operations performed and how many of those operations performed.

There are three types of editing operations:
* **Insertion**: <br>
  Inserts a new character in the string. Insertion has a cost of 1. <br>
  Example: `apple -> apples` and `sly -> slay`.
* **Deletion**: <br>
  Deletes a character from the string. Deletion has a cost of 1. <br>
  Example: `oranges -> orange` and `bandana -> banana`.
* **Substitution**: <br>
  Change a character in the string into another different character. Substitution has a cost of 3. It is more expensive
  to substitute than inserting or deleting a character. <br>
  Example: `prey -> pray` and `like -> lime`.

The smaller the minimum edit distance between two strings, the more similar they are.
The algorithm to compute the minimum edit distance between two strings is implemented on `SuggestionUtil#minimumEditDistance()`.

**Algorithm Explanation**

Suppose there are two strings:
* `X` with length `n`.
* `Y` with length `m`.

Define `D(i, j)` to be the minimum edit distance between the first `i` characters of `X` and the first `j` characters of `Y`.

Consider doing all possible editing operations:
* **Insertion**: <br>
  If `i > j`, then we can insert the character at position `j + 1` in `X` to position `j + 1` at `Y`.
  Hence, `D(i, j) + 1 = D(i, j + 1)` in this case. <br>
  If `i < j`, then we can insert the character at position `i + 1` in `Y` to position `i + 1` at `X`.
  Hence, `D(i, j) + 1 = D(i + 1, j)` in this case. <br>
* **Deletion**: <br>
  If `i > j`, then we can delete the character at position `i` in `X`.
  Hence, `D(i, j) = D(i - 1, j) + 1` in this case. <br>
  If `i < j`, then we can delete the character at position `j` in `Y`.
  Hence, `D(i, j) = D(i, j - 1) + 1` in this case. <br>
* **Substitution**: <br>
  We can change the character at position `i` in X to match the character at position `j` in `Y`, or
  we can change the character at position `j` in `Y` to match the character at position `i` in `X`. <br>
  Hence, `D(i, j) = D(i - 1, j - 1) + 3` in this case. <br>

The base cases for the recursion are:
* `D(i, 0) = i` since the best way is to delete everything from `X` or inserting every character in `X` to `Y`.
* `D(0, j) = j` since the best way is to delete everything from `Y` or inserting every character in `Y` to `X`.

In all possible editing operations, the value `D(i, j)` can only change to:
* `D(i - 1, j) + 1`
* `D(i, j - 1) + 1`
* `D(i - 1, j - 1) + 3`

Since we want to find the minimum edit distance,
`D(i, j) = min(D(i - 1, j) + 1, D(i, j - 1) + 1, D(i - 1, j - 1) + 3)`.

Since it is a recursion, the algorithm is implemented using dynamic programming to improve speed by remembering already
computed states. The current implementation do the following steps:

1. Creates a table to store computed states (2D `dp` array).
2. Fill up the base cases in the table.
3. Using a double for loop, fill up the table according to the recursion formula above.
4. Returns the minimum edit distance between the two strings compared.

**Time complexity**: `O(n * n)` due to the double for loop.

**Space complexity**: `O(n * n)` due to the table.

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the suggestion feature is triggered:

![SuggestionActivityDiagram](images/SuggestionActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: String Comparison Heuristics

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** minimum edit distance heuristic
  * Pros: Provides a good estimate how far apart two strings are. A standard dynamic programming algorithm.
  * Cons: Maybe hard to be understood to people who don't understand dynamic programming.

* **Alternative 2:** substring comparison
  * Pros: Very simple to implement. A brute force algorithm that checks every substring.
  * Cons: The distance estimate between two strings is quite bad, especially if no substring overlaps. Slow in speed
    compared to minimum edit distance. Generates worse suggestion compared to minimum edit distance.

### Statistics Feature

The backend mechanism for statistics feature is facilitated by `StockBookParser, StatisticsCommandParser, StatisticsCommand`
and one of the child command classes of StatisticsCommand that includes (as of documentation):
* `SourceStatisticsCommand`
* `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand`  

The frontend mechanism for statistics feature mainly facilitated by the controller class `StatisticsWindow` for
`StatisticsWindow.fxml`. The choice of display is `JavaFX Piechart` from the `JavaFX Charts`.

#### StatisticsCommandParser
`StatisticsCommandParser` class extends `Parser` interface. `StatisticsCommandParser` class is tasked with parsing the
user inputs (without the command word) and generates a new `StatisticsCommand` object. The `StatisticsCommand` will be one of the
existing child commands stated above.

Upon successful parsing, the `StatisticsCommand` object will then be passed on to the respective child command classes
for logical execution.

If the user inputs do not correspond to any of the `STATISTICS_TYPE` words in the child command classes, an error message
will be shown and no `StatisticsCommand` object will be created.

Some of the more important operations implemented here are:

* `StatisticsCommandParser#parse()` <br>
  Parses the user input and returns a new `StatisticsCommand` object that can be belongs to either one of the
  child classes of `StatisticsCommand`. This is aided by the `StatisticsCommandParser#getStatisticsType()` method.
  
* `StatisticsCommandParser#getStatisticsType()` <br>
  This is a further abstracted method that reads the input string and determines what is the correct statistical type
  command that the user wants.
  
:warning: It is to note that some child classes requires parameters in their constructors for their respective purposes.
  
#### StatisticsCommand

`StatisticsCommand` abstract class extends `Command` interface. While the `StatisticsCommand` class contains minimal
functionality, it serves as an inheritance bridge between the various types of statistics command, to comply with
`SOLID` principles.

The respective child classes will be tasked with consolidating the required data and storing it in a `CommandResult` object.

#### SourceStatisticsCommand
`SourceStatisticsCommand` class extends `StatisticsCommand` class. The `SourceStatisticsCommand` class is tasked with
consolidating the required data and storing it in a `CommandResult` object. The statistics shown by this class
describes the **percentage of the different sources** existing in Warenager.

The format for this command is fixed and is ensured by the parser. Any errors arising from this command will be an
assertion error.

The main operation implemented in `SourceStatisticsCommand` class is:
* `SourceStatisticsCommand#execute()`
  Generates a new `CommandResult`. Some key attributes of this object consists of:
   1. `statisticsData` The statistics data to be displayed.
   2. `otherStatisticsDetails` that includes:
        * Statistics type

#### SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand
`SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand` class extends `StatisticsCommand` class. The
`SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand` requires a single parameter: `targetSource`. The statistics shown by this class
describes the **distribution among the different stocks** of the given `targetSource`.

If the `targetSource` is not found by Warenager, this will result in an error message to be shown to prompt the
user that Warenager cannot find the target source company.

The main operation implemented in `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand` class is:
* `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand#execute()`
  Generates a new `CommandResult`. The key attributes of this object consists of:
   1. `statisticsData` The statistics data to be displayed.
   2. `otherStatisticsDetails` that includes:
        * Statistics type
        * Target source
  
#### StatisticsWindow
`StatisticsWindow` is the controller class for the `StatisticsWindow.fxml`. Here, the piechart in the class is updated
with the correct data corresponding to the command the user inputs. The title will also be customised to the
type of statistics the user wants to display. The compiled data from the `CommandResult` returned by the `#execute`
methods will be read here and supplied to the pie chart.

Some of the more important operations implemented here are:

* `StatisticsWindow#refreshData()` <br>
  This method clears all the current data in the piechart and inserts the correct data depending on the Statistics type
  from `otherStatisticsDetails` in the `CommandResult` object. It then calls the respective methods needed to extract
  the compiled data.
  
* `StatisticsCommandParser#updateDataForSourceQuantityDistributionStatistics()` <br>
  This method is called if the type of statistics is `SourceQuantityDistribution Statistics`. Some calculations are done
  here to provide users with more data.
  
* `StatisticsCommandParser#updateDataForSourceStatistics()` <br>
  This method is called if the type of statistics is `Source Statistics`. Some calculations are done here to provide users
  with more data.
  
#### Example Usage Scenario

Given below are some example usage scenarios and how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

**Example 1: Calling statistics for Source Companies**

Step 1. The user enters `stats st/source`.

Step 2. The command word `stats` is extracted out in `StockBookParser`, in this case, it matches the `COMMAND_WORD`,
        which is `stats` in the `StatisticsCommand` class.

Step 3. The remaining user input is the given to the `StatisticsCommandParser` to determine which type of statistics
        the user wants.

Step 4. Inside `StatisticsCommandParser#parse()` method, the header will be dropped, resulting in the remaining user
        input to be `source`. This matches to the criteria for `SourceStatisticsCommand`, and returning a
        `SourceStatisticsCommand` object.
        
Step 5. The `SourceStatisticsCommand#execute()` is then called by the `Logic Manager`. Data extraction and compilation
        will be done and stored in the returning `CommandResult` object. The `CommandResult` object will also store
        the type of statistics in `otherStatisticsDetails`, in this case will be `source`, for later usage.

Step 6. When the `UiManager` calls the `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand#execute()` method, this will invoke
        `MainWindow#execute()`. This `CommandResult` is of the statistics class, leading to the `MainWindow#handleStatistics()`
         method call. This leads to the `StatisticsWindow#show()` method call.

Step 7. `StatisticsWindow#show()` will then call the `StatisticsWindow#refreshData()` which in turn will determine display the
        data in the desired format, based on the type of statistics from `otherStatisticsDetails` in `CommandResult` from Step 5.
        In this case, `Source Statistics` will be displayed.

Step 8. This will then update the pie chart with both the relevant data, format, and title to suit the type of statistics
        to be shown. The UI of the window to be shown is customised by the styling based on the `StatisticsWindow.fxml` file.
     
Step 9. The updated piechart will be shown in a popup window.

**Example 2: Calling statistics for Source Quantity Distribution**

Step 1. The user enters `stats st/source-qt-ntuc`. `ntuc` is a valid source that exists in Warenager.

Step 2. The command word `stats` is extracted out in `StockBookParser`, in this case, it matches the `COMMAND_WORD`,
        which is `stats` in the `StatisticsCommand` class.

Step 3. The remaining user input is the given to the `StatisticsCommandParser` to determine which type of statistics
        the user wants.

Step 4. Inside `StatisticsCommandParser#parse()` method, the header will be dropped, resulting in the remaining user
        input to be `source-qt-ntuc`. This matches to the criteria for `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand`,
        and returning a `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand` object.
        
Step 5. The `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand#execute()` is then called by the `Logic Manager`. Data
        extraction and compilation will be done and stored in the returning `CommandResult` object. The `CommandResult` object
        will also store the type of statistics in `otherStatisticsDetails`, in this case will be `source-qt-`, for later usage.
        For this command, the `targetSource` will also be stored in `otherStatisticsDetails` as it is needed to customise the
        title for the piechart.

Step 6. When the `UiManager` calls the `SourceQuantityDistributionStatisticsCommand#execute()` method, this will invoke
        `MainWindow#execute()`. This `CommandResult` is of the statistics class, leading to the `MainWindow#handleStatistics()`
        method call. This leads to the `StatisticsWindow#show()` method call.

Step 7. `StatisticsWindow#show()` will then call the `StatisticsWindow#refreshData()` which in turn will determine display the
        data in the desired format, based on the type of statistics from `otherStatisticsDetails` in `CommandResult` from Step 5.
        In this case, `Source Quantity Distribution Statistics` will be displayed.

Step 8. This will then update the pie chart with both the relevant data, format, and title to suit the type of statistics
        to be shown. The UI of the window to be shown is customised by the styling based on the `StatisticsWindow.fxml` file.
     
Step 9. The updated piechart will be shown in a popup window.

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the statistics feature is triggered:

![StatisticsActivityDiagram](images/StatisticsActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: UI view for statistics

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Pop up window.
  * Pros: Window can be resized for clearer view. Reduces panel usage since it does not share a common space
          with the stockcards display.
  * Cons: May impede typing speed if statistics are viewed very often.

* **Alternative 2:** Side-by-side view beside the stock cards.
  * Pros: Reduce interruption between typing.
  * Cons: Statistical views are not often used but rather, only after huge changes over time. In order to display the
          piechart properly, there needs to be a sufficiently large area. This leads to a huge portion of display space
          not being utilised efficiently when other commands are being used.
    
##### Aspect: Choice of charts as the primary display for statistics
Pie chart is being used as the choice of statistical display to aid the lack of relativity between stocks
in Warenager. Absolute numbers of each stock is already displayed by the stockcards in Warenager. Pie charts
are more useful when working out the compositions of the data.

#### Future statistical features
With the expansion of more data fields for each stock, there will be more varieties of statistics that can be
shown based on these new fields.
